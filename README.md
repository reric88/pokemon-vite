# This Project
I am using this project to help teach myself React and API implementation, as well as some additional HTML, CSS and JS methods to further improve my skills. It is a work-in-progress and will be updated frequently for as long as I feel I have something to learn from it, or until a different, more important project comes to mind.

If you have any suggestions or comments, please let me know!
